1. Insert SD card into a Pi.

2. lsblk to find out the dev name of the SD card, e.g., /dev/sda

3. `e2fsck -f /dev/sda1`

4. `resize2fs /dev/sda1 4G` # May make it smaller

The last line of the output will be:

The filesystem on /dev/sda1 is now 1048576 (4k) blocks long.

This means the new file system size is 1048576 x 4k. The number 1048576 depends on the size, and needs to be used in step 6.

5. Use `parted` to shrink partition: `parted /dev/sda`

u <---- Change unit
s <---- Unit as 512 bytes
p <---- Partition table

Will see something like:

Number  Start   End        Size       Type     File system  Flags
 1      40960s  30408704s  30367745s  primary  ext4

6. Calcuate the "End"

Because each 4k block in step 4 is 8x 512 block. Hence:

End = Start + 1048576*8 = 40960 + 1048576*8 = 8429568

7. Recreate the partition

rm 1 <---- Delete partition 1
mkpart <---- Make partition
primary <----- Primary partition
ext4 <------ File system type
40960s <----- Start block. The same as the Start in step 5
8429568s <----- End block. The number calculated in step 6
p  <---- print partition to make sure
quit

8. Copy SD card to image file

sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 of=/Users/kenneth/Downloads/orangepi.img bs=512 count=8429569

8429569 is "End+1". +1 may not be necessary. Just in case block starts from 0.
